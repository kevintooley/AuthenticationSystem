Configuration File setup:

For each role, a configuration file is needed.  I have provided examples for the system 
'admin', 'veterinarian', and 'zookeeper'.  This text files provide instructions to the user. 

CredentialsFile setup:

The CredentialsFile will be maintained by the administrator either by manual entry or the 
menus in the terminal when running as the 'admin' role.  The file is a semi-colon 
delimited file that includes an md5 hash for secure authentication.
